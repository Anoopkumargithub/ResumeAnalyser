I will provide you with two inputs: 
- Resume Text: The candidate's resume in text format.
- Job Description (JD): The job description the candidate is applying for.

Your task is to analyze the resume in context with the JD and provide a detailed, professional report. Focus on matching relevant skills, experiences, and projects, but go beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and intent behind both the resume and the JD. The goal is to help the candidate enhance their resume, making it more aligned with the job and improving their chances of being shortlisted.

Inputs:
- Resume Text: "${resumeText}"
- Job Description: "${jobDescription}"

Return a JSON object containing the following fields:

1. **matchedSkills**: 
    - A list of skills from the resume that align with the skills required in the JD.
    - Include context for each skillâ€”how it was demonstrated through experiences, projects, or achievements.
    - Focus on meaningful alignment, not just keyword matches.

2. **suggestedSkills**: 
    - A list of skills the candidate could add to their resume to better match the JD.
    - Suggest both technical and soft skills where relevant, identifying gaps that could make the resume stronger.
    - Explain why each suggested skill would be beneficial.

3. **matchedProjectsAndInternships**: 
    - Identify specific projects or internships from the resume that closely align with the JD.
    - Provide a context-based explanation of why these experiences are relevant, highlighting technologies, outcomes, or key responsibilities.

4. **rephrasedProjectsAndInternships**: 
    - Offer improved versions of the project or internship descriptions from the resume to better align with the JD.
    - Focus on presenting skills, outcomes, and responsibilities in a professional and impactful way, tailoring them to the job requirements.

5. **resumeImprovementSuggestions**: 
    - Provide actionable suggestions to improve the overall quality and professionalism of the resume.
    - Focus on areas such as structure, clarity, formatting, and how to highlight key achievements effectively.
    - Offer guidance on how to make the resume more impactful, readable, and tailored to the job.
